10/24/2023 Update:
------------------------------------
Overview Milestone:
1. compare results with different strategy
2. If there are 0 of chance, study it with different pattern
3. find the common point and difference when compare to 1 of chance
4. minimize 0 of chance (increase overall chance)
5. handle how to reduce the chance by 09:32 being SELL and BUY time at the same time
6. think about which SELL method is the best (profit maximize) for different stocks (some maybe SMA-5, some maybe EMA-10)
7. idea: 16:00 studied done, look at the relationship between 09:30/09:31 and SMA-5/SMA-10/EMA-5/EMA-10
8. try to add more strategy in 09:30/09:31 to verify the result until the chance get higher, otherwise, go back to step 2
9. try the strategy with different code (NVDA,COST,CELH,ULTA,CMG,AVGO,...) to find the most suitable stocks
10. apply them for backtesting again (with one to two years historical data)
11. if backtesting is done with higher chance, prepare and mark down certain stocks with higher chance (CSV review)
12. plan methods to stop the earn or lost with different situations (when the chance is 0 or 1)
13. write the second program to review the performance of that certain stocks after market closed (16:00:00)
14. find the best triggers based on 16:00:00 criteria (daily today SMA > yesterday SMA + 1 min SMA > lower or < higher value)
15. download the most suitable stocks data to local SQL server automatically everyday (offline data storage for reducing the latency in the next day)
16. write the third program to access API for the real time data for 09:30:00 and 09:31:00
17. conduct data analysis based on offline 16:00:00 data and online 09:30:00 and 09:31:00 data to send a buy alert (CALL/PUT)
18. write the forth program to monitor every second and send a sell alert (CALL/PUT) with different methods based on the stocks we bought
19. conduct onsite testing for first several days to check if it works really with certain earning, otherwise, go back to step 10
20. combine all of the programs into one main program
21. conduct graphical user interface for convenience in Desktop
22. release local API for future use
23. develop ios application to get alert through local API for convenience
24. revamp the main program to be C++ for lower latency

11/26/2023 update:
------------------------------------
To-do list:
1. write the second program as pre-analysis after 16:00 market closed for certain stocks
2. temporarily we need to input some certain stocks code manually (we can find on financial statements, technology stocks)
3. the program will first read CSV for each chosen stocks
4. ignore sell method with 09:32 then calculate the most recommended sell method (the highest chance with SMA/EMA)
5. also calculate the cut 09:32 (meant it is cut loss, not earn), calcualte the earning chance (non-09:32)
6. compare the chance with other stocks, then rank it by order, list it with recommended sell method
7. automatically save the result into local (another CSV) for further use (offline data)
8. write the third program as pre-analysis before 09:30 market closed for certain stocks
9. the program will read all the historical data within the history folder automatically
10. Just like the second program, it will add one more condition at 09:25 for a ready
11. 16:00 data will be read offline from local generated by the second program, and 09:25 data should be get online (real-time)
12. after finished, it will develop a forth program (change back to 09:30, add 09:31, and then keep monitoring until sell method triggers)
13. automatically save the result into local (another CSV)
14. The first program will be automatically updated the latest data everyday (create another program, or add this function to the second pre-analysis program)
15. create a GUI to combine all of the functions

12/27/2023 update:
------------------------------------
To-do list:
